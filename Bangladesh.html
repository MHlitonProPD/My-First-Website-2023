     <p>Bangladesh is the only nation in the world who sacrifices blood for the sake of Mother’s tongue. It was 21st February in 1952; Bangladeshi people start the movement against the government of Pakistan for the Bengali Language. In that action, Salem, Rafique, Barkat, Shafiul, and many others sacrifice their lives. At last Pakistan, the government is forced to declare Bengali, as a state language of Bangladesh.

       <br>
       <br> After that day, to commemorate the sacrifice of our national heroes in this day is observed. In the year of 1999, United Nations General Assembly provides recognition of the day and UNESCO first declared this day as “International Mother Language Day.”</p>





<!-- Major rivers in bangladesh............................................................!!!!!!!-->


     <h1 style="color: rgb(248, 14, 14);font-size: 30px; " ><b>Major Rivers Of Bangladesh</b></h1>
     <img src="images/Bangladesh/The Brahmaputra Rive.webp" alt="The Brahmaputra River">
     <h4 style="color: rgb(153, 153, 243);" >The Brahmaputra River, one of the most important in Asia, flows through Bangladesh.</h4>


     <p>Bangladesh is renowned for its beautiful geomorphic features, including the massive rivers flowing throughout the country. Within the borders of Bangladesh lie the bottom reaches of the Himalayan Ranges' water sources, which serve as the primary sources for rivers that flow through such countries as China, Bhutan, and India and eventually passing into the Bay of Bengal in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Rivers also drive various economic activities such as agriculture, waterway communication, and energy source among others. Since these rivers play a significant role in the economic growth, it is therefore deemed important to study some of the major rivers in Bangladesh, focusing on the countries they flow through.
         The following are some of the major rivers in Bangladesh.</p>

    <h1><b style="color: rgb(10, 0, 26) ;" >Brahmaputra River</b></h1>          
    <p>The Brahmaputra River is one of the greatest in Asia and the longest to pass through Bangladesh, covering a length of 1,802 miles, and also cutting across India, Bhutan, and China. It starts from Kailash in northern Tibet and ends in the Bay of Bengal. The Assam people see this river as both a blessing and a curse citing the floods it causes on the adjacent land during the monsoon but leaves an immensely fertile ground after the floods. Peasants take advantage of this land not only to plant food for their use but also for export purposes. Despite its significance to the Assamese,
        the river is also prone to surface water pollution that arises from oil spillages from vehicles and nearby factories.</p>

    <h1><b style="color: rgb(10, 0, 26) ;" >Ganges River</b></h1>
    <p>The River Ganges originates from the Himalaya Mountains and it is accompanied by three distinct courses of flow, namely its upper, middle, and lower courses. Famous for its large water basin, it stretches over a distance of 1,569 miles cutting through India and Bangladesh. Over the years, the surrounding area has always been liable to floods causing numerous effects to the inhabitants living nearby. Despite all these effects that are detrimental to the residents,
        the floods also bring some benefits of land fertility.</p>
